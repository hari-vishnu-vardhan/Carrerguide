            <h2>Welcome to Diploma Education Revolution</h2>
            <p>Diploma education is now more career-focused, industry-driven, and skill-enhancing than ever before. Whether you’re interested in Engineering, Healthcare, Design, or IT, diplomas offer a fast-track to professional success.</p>

            <h3>📚 What is a Diploma?</h3>
